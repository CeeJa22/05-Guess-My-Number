Guessing Game
                                                                  
A simple game that generates a random number between 1-20. The goal is to get the perfect score of 20, with each wrong guess a point is deducted. HTML and CSS is from Udemy, and most of the JS is done by me.

Dice Roll Game

First to 20 wins, every roll you get a random number, but roll a 1 and your score resets. HTML and CSS from Udemy, but more than 90% of JS is from me. I am progressively getting better.
